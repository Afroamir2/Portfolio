# Portfolio
üìÇ Portfolio Overview

Welcome to my coding and data science portfolio! This repository showcases various projects spanning machine learning, clustering algorithms, parallel computing, and financial data analysis. Each project explores a unique problem, implementing efficient computational solutions using Python, C, MPI, and R.

üöÄ Projects

1Ô∏è‚É£ Farthest First Algorithm

A C implementation of the Farthest First Traversal Algorithm, commonly used for k-means clustering initialization. The algorithm selects initial cluster centers by iteratively choosing the farthest point from the current set of centers.

2Ô∏è‚É£ K-Means Clustering

A hybrid Python & C implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm, applied to datasets like MNIST and image segmentation. The project optimizes centroid selection and updates for efficient clustering performance.

3Ô∏è‚É£ MPI K-Means Clustering

A parallelized K-Means clustering implementation using MPI, designed to run efficiently across multiple CPU cores. The project demonstrates scalability and speedup analysis, achieving ~30x acceleration on 32 cores.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Global Loan Dynamics (Final Project)

A financial data analysis project examining regional disparities in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan commitments. The study applies PCA and K-Means Clustering to identify global loan distribution trends.
